  abstract    = {Android application development has been of interest since the first Android smartphone was released. Applications are constantly getting more complex as well as smartphone hardware is getting better. New ways of developing Android applications are developed with time. There is Model View Presenter architecture that is the most used for android applications now and new View InteractorPresenter Entity Router architecture that is becoming more popular. But there is no empirical data to compare these architectures to understand what architecture will fit better for developing new applications. This thesis aims to compare the MVP and the VIPER android architectures using a few important metrics like maintainability, modifiability, testability, and performance. Results will answer what architecture is better for developing different types of projects. VIPERarchitecture showed better performance results and maintenance metrics comparison shows that both architectures have advantages and disadvantages. },
